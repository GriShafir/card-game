# Card Game
This is a typical Python game with cards.

If you JUST want to play the game, you can download `main.py` file only. To get the menu (doesn't work tho), follow these steps: 
1. Download `main.py` file
2. Download `menu.py` file
3. Start `menu.py` file
4. ???
5. Done!

Rules:
      <p>At the start, you are given 7 <i>cards</i> with random numbers, from 0 to 9. There are also the <i>current card</i> and the <i>master card</i>.</p>
      <p>The <i>current card</i> is the card you need to replace with one of your card. The <i>master card</i> is the card that has the <i>master number</i> - if one of your cards has a number equal to the master number, then you can use it whenever you want.</p>
      <p>You can use one of your cards only if the number on the current card is smaller than the number on your card. Otherwise, you won't be able to replace the current card.</p>
      <p>If there are 10 current cards, then you gain all current cards from there until you have 5 cards. If you already have 5 or more cards, you won't gain any of current cards.</p>
      <p id="cheats">Also, there are some cheatcodes in the game. Can you find them all?</p>
